    ingredients:
      "3 1/2 c Chicken broth; homemade|1 lb Fresh spinach; wash/trim/chop|1 Egg|1 c Grated parmesan cheese; --or--|1 c Romano cheese; freshly grated|Salt and pepper; to taste",
    servings: "4 servings",
    instructions:
      "Bring 1 cup of the broth to a boil. Add spinach and cook until softened but still bright green. Remove spinach with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add remaining broth to pot. Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, beat egg lightly with a fork. Beat in 1/4 cup of cheese. When broth boils, pour in egg mixture, stirring constantly for a few seconds until it cooks into 'rags.' Add reserved spinach, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately, passing remaining cheese. NOTES: Someone asked for this recipe a while back. I believe this soup, known as Stracciatella, is synonymous with Italian Wedding Soup; however, I seem to remember from I-don't-know-where that Italian Wedding Soup is the same as this but with the addition of tiny meatballs.",
